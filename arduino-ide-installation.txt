A new Arduino version 2.0.0 was just released. This one incorporates the
Teensy system, so a separate Teensyduino app is no longer needed.

Remove all existing Arduino installation files:
  - Remove Arduino and Teensyduino from the /Applications folder
  - From your home directory, remove the "Libraries/Arduino15" folder
  - In the Documents/Teensy/libraries directory, remove everything
    except the "Tactile" directory (e.g. the SD, SdFat, and so forth).
  
Install Arduino 2.0:
  - Download from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
  - Double-click the downloaded .dmg file
  - Drag the Arduino icon into the Applications folder icon

Run the new Arduino 2.0 program.
  - It will ask for several permissions (keyboard, access to
    your Documents folder, and incoming internet connections.
    Allow these. It will take you to "System Preferences" for
    some of this. When done, it advises that you need to restart
    Arduino for the changes to take effect; don't restart yet.

Select the sketchbook location:
  - Open "Arduino IDE-->Preferences"
  - Click "Browse" next to the "Sketchbook location" box, and select
    your "Documents/Teensy" directory.

Quit Arduino and restart it.
  - It will advise you that some libraries can be updated. Click "Update
    All". Wait for it to finish.

Add the Teensy board to Arduino's list of supported hardware
  - Open "Arduino IDE-->Preferences"
  - At the very bottom, in the "Additional Board Manager URLs", enter this:
      https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/package_teensy_index.json
  - Click "OK" to close the Preferences, then wait ... it will take several
    minutes to import all of the Teensy features. You may see some errors
    at the end due to duplicate Adafruit libraries; you can ignore these.

Select the Teensy 4.1 board:
  - Plug the Teensy 4.1 into the USB.
  - At the top of the Arduino window, click the "Boards" menu. It may take
    a couple seconds to find the Teensy 4.1. When it does, click that.
